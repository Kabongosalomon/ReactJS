// To find the length of a string (in code units), access its length property:
'hello'.length; // 5

// There's our first brush with JavaScript objects! Did we mention that you can use strings like objects too? 
// They have methods as well that allow you to manipulate the string and access information about the string:
'hello'.charAt(0); // "h"
'hello, world'.replace('world', 'mars'); // "hello, mars"
'hello'.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO"
