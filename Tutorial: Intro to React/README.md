# Tutorial: Intro to React

## Before We Start the Tutorial

The tutorial is divided into several sections:

    - Setup for the Tutorial will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.
    - Overview will teach you the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.
    - Completing the Game will teach you the most common techniques in React development.
    - Adding Time Travel will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React.

You don’t have to complete all of the sections at once to get the value out of this tutorial. Try to get as far as you can — even if it’s one or two sections.

## What Are We Building?
In this tutorial, we’ll show how to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.

You can see what we’ll be building here: [Final Result](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010). If the code doesn’t make sense to you, or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax.

We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.

You can close the tic-tac-toe game once you’re familiar with it. We’ll be starting from a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.
